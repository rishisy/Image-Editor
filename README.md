## Grayscale Conversion

The grayscale function converts a color image to grayscale. It calculates the average of the red, green, and blue components of each pixel and sets them all to the same value.
## Sepia Tone Effect

The sepia function applies a sepia tone effect to the image. It uses a set of weighted averages to transform the color of each pixel, giving it a warm, vintage look.
## Horizontal Reflection

The reflect function horizontally flips the image. It mirrors the image from left to right.
## Image Blurring

The blur function applies a blurring effect to the image. It calculates the average color of neighboring pixels and sets the pixel's color to that average.
